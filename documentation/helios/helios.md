# Helios: Asteria Server

## What is Helios?

Helios is a low-level server, built over [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), that provides developer a robust environement to build Asteria distributed applications.

Developer can also use [Crios](https://github.com/asteria-project/asteria-crios), the high-level distribution of the Helios server, to easily deploy their Asteria apps.
